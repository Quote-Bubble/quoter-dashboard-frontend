  },
  {
    q: "Can I change my prices?",
    a: "Yes — head to the Account page and update your material rates, day rate, skip hire and scaffold costs. New quotes use your latest prices automatically.",
  },
  {
    q: "What does the access rating mean?",
    a: "It reflects how hard the roof is to work on — pitch, number of roof planes and property type. Difficult roofs usually need more scaffolding and time, so it's a flag to price carefully before you commit.",
  },
  {
    q: "How do I add Quoter to my website?",
    a: "We give you a single snippet to paste into your site — or send it to whoever manages it. Once it's in, the quote bubble appears and leads start arriving here. Contact us and we'll walk you through it.",
